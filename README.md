# dxforge

_An API-based orchestration platform by DivergeX_

The dxforge suite is aimed at small teams and large teams that plan on scaling, reducing costs and maintenance of
quantitative trading strategies.

The framework focuses on managing different strategies, their instances, feeds and portfolios
via distributed and scalable nodes, without the need of managing them individually.

With a K8s + Docker based approach, the framework is designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant and stress-tested.

## Getting Started

### Installation

If you prefer not to go through the installation process or simply want to run the `strategy_manager` without having
Python and the dependencies set up, you can use the precompiled executables. This is especially useful for deployment or
sharing with users who might not be familiar with Python environments.

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
gnome-session-quit
```

```bash
docker ps
```

1. Navigate to the [Releases section](https://github.com/divergex/strategy-manager/releases).
2. Download the appropriate file for your operating system:
    - `strategy_manager.sh` for Linux/macOS
    - `strategy_manager.exe` for Windows
3. After downloading, follow the instructions below.

### For Linux/macOS Users

1. First, you'll need to extract the compressed file. If you've downloaded the \`**strategy_manager_linux.tar.gz**\`
   from the releases, you can decompress it using the following command:

```bash
tar -xzvf strategy_manager_linux.tar.gz
```

This will extract the contents, including strategy_manager.sh (the shell script) and the actual compiled binary
strategy_manager.

To run the dxforge using the shell script:

2. Access the directory containing the sample strategy and feed managers

    ```bash
    cd strategy-manager
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    ./dist/strategy-manager [config_file] [--host] [--port]
    # e.g. ./dist/strategy-manager config.yaml
    ```

Replace `[arguments]` with any command-line arguments you wish to pass to the dxforge.

### For Windows Users

A standalone executable named `strategy-manager.exe` is available for Windows users.

To run the dxforge using the executable:

1. Navigate to the directory containing the project files using the Command Prompt or PowerShell.
    ```powershell
   cd strategy-manager
   ```    

2. Run the executable:

    ```powershell
    .\dist\strategy-manager.exe [config_file] [--host] [--port]
    # e.g. .\dist\strategy-manager.exe config.yaml
    ```

Replace `[arguments]` with any command-line arguments you wish to pass to the dxforge.

**Note**: The first time you run these executables, your operating system might prompt you to verify if you trust
software from the publisher. Ensure you trust the source (in this case, the `strategy_manager` project) before
proceeding.

## Developing
### Compiling from Source

#### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `virtualenv` or any other virtual environment manager

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:divergex/dxforge.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory and create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - For Linux/macOS:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
    - For Windows:
      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

4. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Server

To start the dxforge instance locally, run:

```bash
python dxforge/main.py config.yaml
```

Optional command-line arguments:

- `--host` to specify the host (default is `0.0.0.0`)
- `--port` to specify the port (default is `8000`)

## Functionalities

- **Listing Strategies**:  
  Visit `http://localhost:8000/strategy/` to get a list of all available strategies.

- **Refreshing Strategy Status**:  
  POST request to `http://localhost:8000/strategy/` to refresh the status of all strategies.

- **Proxy Get Routes for a Strategy**:  
  GET request to `http://localhost:8000/strategy/{strategy}/` to get routes available for a strategy.

- **Proxy Get and Post Methods for a Strategy Endpoint**:
    - GET: `http://localhost:8000/strategy/{strategy}/{endpoint}`
    - POST: `http://localhost:8000/strategy/{strategy}/{endpoint}` with appropriate data payload.

## Sample strategy for testing

A sample strategy folder (`strategies/rsi-strategy`) is provided to demonstrate how to use the `dxlib` library.
This script uses historical stock data for a set of tickers, runs a simple RSI strategy on the data, and calculates a
list of signals.

To run the sample dxforge instance:

```bash
python strategies/rsi-strategy/run.py
```

And in another terminal, run the dxforge:

```bash
 python app.py config.yaml
# or
# ./dist/dxforge config.yaml
```

## Configuration

Managers can be added or removed by modifying the a _yaml_ file.

Example:
_**config.yaml**_

```yaml
{
  "feeds": "feeds/docker-compose.yaml",
  "strategies": "strategies/docker-compose.yaml",
  "port": "5000",
  "host": "0.0.0.0"
}
```

In this configuration, `strategies` has a list of docker compose services that serve on different ports. These available
ports can be accessed at `http://localhost:5000`.
